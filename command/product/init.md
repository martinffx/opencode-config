# Initialize Spec-Driven Development Project

Initialize this repository for Spec-Driven Development (SDD) workflows.

## Step 1: Check Current State

@clerk verify project initialization status.

Check if already initialized:
```bash
test -f docs/product/product.md
```

If `docs/product/product.md` exists:
- WARN: "Project already initialized. Existing files will be preserved."
- Ask user: "Continue anyway? (This will create missing directories/files but preserve existing ones)"
- If user declines → EXIT

## Step 2: Infer Product Name

@clerk detect product name from directory contents.

Try in order (use first match):

1. **Check package.json:**
```bash
test -f package.json && cat package.json | grep '"name"' | head -n 1
```
Extract value from `"name": "value"` field

2. **Check git remote:**
```bash
git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null
```
Extract repository name from URL (e.g., `github.com/user/repo.git` → `repo`)

3. **Fallback to directory name:**
```bash
basename "$PWD"
```

Store detected name as `PRODUCT_NAME`.

## Step 3: Create Directory Structure

@clerk create base SDD directories.

```bash
mkdir -p docs/spec docs/product docs/standards
```

Verify creation:
```bash
ls -la docs/
```

## Step 4: Conduct Discovery Interview for Requirements

@oracle conduct guided product discovery interview.

Ask user these questions (one at a time):

**1. Vision Statement**
What is the vision for **{{PRODUCT_NAME}}**?
(Describe the purpose and goals of this product in 1-2 sentences)

[Wait for response → store as VISION]

**2. Target Users**
Who are the target users of **{{PRODUCT_NAME}}**?
(List the primary user types or personas)

[Wait for response → store as TARGET_USERS]

**3. Core Features**
What are the 3-5 core features of **{{PRODUCT_NAME}}**?
(List the main capabilities users need)

[Wait for response → store as CORE_FEATURES]

**4. Technical Constraints**
What technical constraints should we know about?
(e.g., tech stack, performance requirements, integrations, scalability needs)

[Wait for response → store as CONSTRAINTS]

## Step 5: Create Product Document

@clerk create product document from template.

Create product document:
- Read template: `~/.config/opencode/assets/templates/product.md`
- Replace placeholders:
  - `{{PRODUCT_NAME}}` → actual product name
  - `{{VISION}}` → vision statement
  - `{{TARGET_USERS}}` → target users
  - `{{CORE_FEATURES}}` → core features list
  - `{{CONSTRAINTS}}` → technical constraints
  - `{{DATE}}` → current date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- Write to `docs/product/product.md` (skip if exists):
  ```bash
  test ! -f docs/product/product.md && cat > docs/product/product.md <<'EOF'
  [filled template content]
  EOF
  ```

## Step 5b: Analyze Technical Constraints

@architect analyze technical constraints and recommend architectural patterns.

From discovered constraints, identify:
- Appropriate architectural patterns (layered, event-driven, microservices, etc.)
- Technology stack implications (frameworks, databases, infrastructure)
- Performance considerations (caching, async processing, scaling)
- Integration patterns required (APIs, messaging, external services)

Load relevant skill based on tech stack:
- TypeScript/JavaScript → `skill:typescript` or `skill:nodejs`
- Python → `skill:python`
- React → `skill:react`
- Rust → `skill:rust`
- Go → `skill:go`

Provide recommendations for standards documents:
- Suggested patterns for `architecture.md`
- Coding conventions based on tech stack for `coding.md`

## Step 6: Create Standards Documents

@clerk create standards documents from templates.

Create standards documents:
- Copy coding.md template (skip if exists):
  ```bash
  test ! -f docs/standards/coding.md && \
    cp ~/.config/opencode/assets/templates/coding.md docs/standards/coding.md
  ```
- Copy architecture.md template (skip if exists):
  ```bash
  test ! -f docs/standards/architecture.md && \
    cp ~/.config/opencode/assets/templates/architecture.md docs/standards/architecture.md
  ```
- Verify creation:
  ```bash
  ls -la docs/standards/
  ```

## Step 7: Initialize Beads (Optional)

@clerk check and initialize task tracker.

Check if Beads is installed:
```bash
bd --version 2>/dev/null
```

If Beads found:
- Run initialization:
```bash
bd init
```
- Report: "✓ Beads task tracker initialized"

If Beads not found:
- Report: "⚠ Beads not installed. Install with: npm install -g @beads/bd"
- Note: "You can still use SDD workflows without Beads, but task tracking will be manual"

## Initialization Complete

**Project initialized for Spec-Driven Development!**

### Created Structure:
```
docs/
├── spec/             # Feature specifications (one directory per feature)
│   └── <feature>/
│       ├── spec.md   # Unified requirements + technical design
├── product/          # Product-level docs
│   └── product.md    # ✓ Created with {{PRODUCT_NAME}} context
└── standards/        # Technical standards
    ├── coding.md     # ✓ Created with TDD patterns and conventions
    └── architecture.md # ✓ Created with layered architecture patterns
```

### Next Steps:

1. **Review and customize standards:**
   - Edit `docs/standards/coding.md` for your coding conventions
   - Edit `docs/standards/architecture.md` for your architecture patterns

2. **Create your first feature spec:**
   ```bash
   /spec init <feature-name>
   ```

3. **Optional: Install Beads for task tracking** (if not installed):
   ```bash
   npm install -g @beads/bd
   bd init
   ```

**SDD Philosophy:**
- Lightweight specs over heavy planning
- Dependency-driven over sprint-driven
- AI-assisted implementation
- Prevention over debugging

Happy building! 🚀
